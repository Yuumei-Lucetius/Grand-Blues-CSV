# Grand Blues Comic Strip Viewer
A web application allowing the viewing of comic strips originating from Cygames' mobage, Granblue Fantasy's, inhouse comic series: Grand Blues. 

The landing point is the first strip of the series, where strips can be switched between using the left and right arrow buttons (as well as the arrows displayed on the page). The menu modal displays which comic strip the user is currently viewing, and allows the selection of a custom numbered strip.
